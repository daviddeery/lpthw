# Rules for if-statements.
# Every if-statement must have an else.
# If this else should never run because if doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies. e.g. exit(0). This will find many errors.
# Never next if-statements more than two deep and try and have them only one deep.
# Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
# Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.

# Rules for loops
# Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This only applies to Python. Other languages are different.
# Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.

# Check out Iterators, generators and decorators.
