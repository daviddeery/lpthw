# % is the modulus operator i.e. the remainder from division on integers.
# The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second.
# e.g. 3/4 = 0.75; 3%4 = 3
#  - infront of a number denotes a negative number
# >= greater than or equal to - boolean - returns true or false
# <= less than or equal to - boolean - returns true or false
